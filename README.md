# UnityDecompiled
#### An unofficial repo of decompiled Unity dll files

Unfortunately I had to remove the UnityDecompiled repo due to a request from Unity's legal team. 

If you'd like to decompile Unity yourself, find your local UnityEditor.dll and decompile it using either [ILSpy](http://ilspy.net) or [dotPeek](https://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/)

Note that Unity UI is open source. Get it from [https://bitbucket.org/Unity-Technologies/ui/](https://bitbucket.org/Unity-Technologies/ui/)

Thanks to the community for all of your contributions over the past three years, it was a great resource while it lasted!
